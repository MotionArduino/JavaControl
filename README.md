JavaControl
===========

These code write with java, they receive hand gestures from LeapMotion then turn it into control commands, then send it to arduino via RS232

How to use
===========

1. These code only support Windows currently, because the RS232 driver we use only support Windows;
2. Clone the code and import it with eclipse;
3. Run the MotionXXX java files, like : MotionMeArm;
4. Every program would ask you to input COM port first, which used to communicate with Arduino;
